<h3><a name="local"></a>Installation in local machine</h3>
<p>Step 1: Check that your machine has installed Internet Information Server, 
  Personal Web Server or any other Web Server supporting the execution of Active 
  Server Pages (ASP) scripts. If you find a folder c:\InetPub, it is likely that 
  you have the web server needed to run Comersus Shopping Cart. </p>
<p>Step 2: Copy comersus folder in c:\Inetpub\wwwRoot. The resulting folder structure 
  should be the following: </p>
<p><img src="store/images/qg_folders.gif" width="229" height="188" alt="Cart folder structure"></p>
<p>Step 3: Open your browser and type the following URL: http://localhost/comersus. 
  Press Enter. The Installation Wizard will appear to set up your store easily. 
</p>

</p>
<p><i>Note: If your c:\InetPub\comersus\database\ folder has write, read, and 
  delete permissions disabled by default, you should enable them manually. You 
  will find detailed instructions for this task in Comersus User's Guide. </i></p>

<h3><a name="remote"></a>Installation in remote hosting</h3>
<p>Step 1: Check with your hosting service tech support that your website supports 
  Active Server Pages (ASP) scripts. </p>
<p>Step 2: Connect to your remote server with an FTP program (you can download 
  one from <a href="http://www.cuteftp.com" target="_blank">http://www.cuteftp.com</a> 
  if necessary), with the connection information provided by your hosting service. 
</p>
<p><img src="store/images/qg_ftp.gif" width="500" height="236" alt="E-commerce Installation by FTP"></p>
<p>Step 3: Copy comersus folder in your remote web server's root directory. If 
  you find several remote folders when you connect, ask the hosting service tech 
  support where the files are located (they are usually placed in the root, the 
  /public folder, or the /wwwRoot folder). </p>
<p>Step 4: Ask your hosting service tech support to assign all permissions on 
  the comersus/database folder and on the comersus/database/comersus.mdb file. 
</p>
<p>Step 5: Open your browser and type the following URL: http://www.yoursite.com/comersus. 
  Press Enter. The Installation Wizard will appear to set up your store easily. 
</p>
<p><i>Note: You should replace www.yoursite.com with your website domain, for 
  example www.smithbooks.com/comersus, www.jacksonllc.com/comersus, etc. </i></p>
